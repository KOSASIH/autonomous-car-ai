# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Clone the repository:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/autonomous-car-ai.git
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
1. python3 -m venv env
2. source env/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages:

```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Train the model:

```
1. python train.py --model-dir=models/ --num-episodes=1000
```
This will train the model for 1000 episodes and save the trained model to the models directory.

Test the model:

```
1. python test.py --model-dir=models/ --num-episodes=10
```

This will test the model for 10 episodes and display the results.

# Notes

- The train.py script uses the OpenAI Gym environment for training the model. The environment is defined in the env.py module.
- The model.py module contains the definition of the neural network architecture and the training loop.
- The load_data.py module contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- The utils.py module contains utility functions for visualizing the results and saving the trained model.

# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

# Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

Clone the repository:

```
1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/autonomous-car-ai.git
```

Create a virtual environment:

```
1. python3 -m venv env
2. source env/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages:

```
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Train the model:

```
1. python train.py --model-dir=models/ --num-episodes=1000
```
This will train the model for 1000 episodes and save the trained model to the models directory.

Test the model:

```
1. python test.py --model-dir=models/ --num-episodes=10
```

This will test the model for 10 episodes and display the results.

# Notes

- The train.py script uses the OpenAI Gym environment for training the model. The environment is defined in the env.py module.
- The model.py module contains the definition of the neural network architecture and the training loop.
- The load_data.py module contains functions for loading and preprocessing the data.
- The utils.py module contains utility functions for visualizing the results and saving the trained model.

# Data Collection

Data collection is an important step in building an autonomous car AI system. The system needs to learn from data to make decisions and navigate through the environment. Here are some ways to collect data for an autonomous car AI system:

1. Simulation: One way to collect data is to use a simulation environment. A simulation environment can generate a large amount of data quickly and easily. The autonomous car AI system can be trained on the simulated data and then tested in the real world.
2. Driving Logs: Another way to collect data is to use driving logs from real cars. Driving logs contain data such as sensor readings, GPS coordinates, and steering angles. The autonomous car AI system can be trained on the driving logs to learn how to navigate through the environment.
3. Crowdsourcing: Crowdsourcing is another way to collect data. Crowdsourcing involves collecting data from a large number of people. For example, the autonomous car AI system can be integrated with a mobile app, and users can contribute data by driving with the app.
4. Public Datasets: There are also public datasets available for autonomous driving. For example, the KITTI dataset contains data from a driving car, including images, lidar point clouds, and GPS coordinates. The autonomous car AI system can be trained on the public datasets to learn how to navigate through the environment.
Once the data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed and labeled. Preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for training. Labeling involves assigning labels to the data, such as steering angles or obstacle locations. The labeled data can then be used to train the autonomous car AI system.

It's important to note that data collection and preprocessing can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, it's a critical step in building an autonomous car AI system, and the quality of the data can significantly impact the performance of the system.
